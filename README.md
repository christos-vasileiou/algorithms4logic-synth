# logic synthesis for IC Design
Logic synthesis in the semiconductor design is a vital phase where high-level descriptions of digital circuits are transformed into structural netlists. These netlists comprise logical elements like gates and flip-flops, enabling efficient implementation on integrated circuits. This repo is the implementation of a series of homeworks that are part of the class [CAD algorithms](https://courses.e-ce.uth.gr/ECE431/) (ECE431) in the University of Thessaly at Volos, Greece. Each homework is dependent on the implementation of the previous homework.

* `1hw`: TCl Shell implementation, file and command tab-completion, integration of regular shell commands

* `2hw`: ...

* `3hw`: ...

* `4hw`: ...
