# logic synthesis for IC Design
Logic synthesis in the semiconductor design is a vital phase where high-level descriptions of digital circuits are transformed into structural netlists. These netlists comprise logical elements like gates and flip-flops, enabling efficient implementation on integrated circuits. This repo is an implementation of homeworks are part of the class CAD algorithms[[CAD algorithms](https://courses.e-ce.uth.gr/ECE431/)] (ECE431) in the University of Thessaly at Volos, Greece.
